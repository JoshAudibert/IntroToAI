Things that I learned while doing out by hand that can help optimize our code:\
\
1. If bash only expand Forward node \
2. Facing an edge you don\'92t consider Forward or Bash \
3. Don\'92t consider bash if 1 away from an edge \
4. Don\'92t consider and node you have already visited in a sequence \
5. The most turns you can do in a row is 2 (Tl ,Tl or Tr, Tr) \
6. You can\'92t turn the opposite way you have just turned (ex if i just turned left I can\'92t turn right ) \
7. Don\'92t consider bash if number is not greater to or equal to 4 \
